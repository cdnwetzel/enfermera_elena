```

### Day 3: Mexican PHI Implementation
```python
# Create: src/deid/rules_mexico.py
class MexicanPHIRules:
    patterns = {
        'CURP': r'[A-Z]{4}\d{6}[HM][A-Z]{5}[A-Z0-9]\d',
        'RFC': r'[A-Z]{4}\d{6}[A-Z0-9]{3}',
        'NSS': r'\d{11}',
        'FOLIO': r'[Ff]olio[\s:]*[\d\-]+'
    }
```

### Day 4: Medical Mapping Integration
```python
# Create: src/mt/mexican_medical_mapper.py
class MexicanMedicalMapper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.umls = UMLSClient()
        self.cofepris = load_cofepris_db()
        self.beto = load_beto_model()
```

### Day 5: Pipeline Integration
```python
# Modify: src/pipeline.py
def run_pipeline(pdf_in, pdf_out, cfg):
    # ... existing OCR code ...
    
    # Add Mexican medical layer
    if cfg.mexican_mode:
        text = mexican_medical_enhance(text)
    
    # Continue with translation
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Blockers to Address

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| SNOMED CT Mexico access delay | High | Use UMLS as fallback | Plan B ready |
| UMLS API rate limits | Medium | Cache frequently used terms | Design ready |
| Model size (GPU memory) | Medium | Use quantization/pruning | Known solution |
| OCR accuracy on forms | High | Test with real IMSS forms | Need samples |

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Developer**: 1 full-time (you)
- **Medical Expert**: Part-time consultation (find Mexican physician)
- **QA Tester**: Part-time (could be same as medical expert)

### Infrastructure
- **Development Machine**: GPU preferred but not required initially
- **Cloud Credits**: ~$100 for initial API testing
- **Storage**: ~50GB for models and data

### Timeline
- **MVP**: 2 weeks (basic functionality)
- **Beta**: 4 weeks (refined with medical validation)
- **Production**: 8 weeks (fully tested and optimized)

## Decision Points

### Immediate Decisions Needed

1. **Translation Service**: AWS vs Google vs Both?
   - Recommendation: Start with Google (simpler), add AWS later

2. **Deployment Target**: On-premise vs Cloud?
   - Recommendation: Docker container for flexibility

3. **Medical Validation**: How to get Mexican physician input?
   - Options: Freelance, partnership with clinic, academic collaboration

4. **Testing Data**: Real IMSS documents?
   - Need: De-identified samples from Mexican healthcare

## Quality Gates Before Coding

### Must Have Before Starting
- [x] Scaffold code analyzed ‚úÖ
- [x] Architecture defined ‚úÖ

- [ ] HIPAA compliance review

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ‚úÖ **GO DECISION - Ready to Start**

**Rationale:**
1. Planning documents complete
2. Scaffold provides 70% of code needed
3. Clear implementation path
4. Resources identified
5. Risk mitigation strategies defined

### Recommended Start Date: **Tomorrow**

**Day 1 Actions:**
1. Morning: Register for UMLS
2. Afternoon: Set up development environment
3. Evening: Fork scaffold and run first test

## Useful ChatPS Components to Integrate

### From ChatPS_v2_ng
```python
# 1. GPU Caching (cached_gpu_query.py)
- Reuse for BETO model caching
- Adapt batch processing patterns

# 2. Pattern Recognition (pattern_recognition_engine.py)
- Extract PHI detection patterns
- Add Mexican-specific rules

# 3. Knowledge Graph (if exists)
- Medical concept relationships
- UMLS graph navigation

# 4. Context Enrichment
- Maintain document context
- Medical history tracking
```

### Integration Strategy
```bash
# Copy useful modules
cp ChatPS_v2_ng/modules/cached_gpu_query.py enfermera_elena/src/utils/
cp ChatPS_v2_ng/modules/pattern_recognition_engine.py enfermera_elena/src/deid/

# Adapt for medical use
# - Remove PS-specific code
# - Add medical context
# - Integrate with scaffold
```

## Final Checklist

### Before Writing First Line of Code
- [ ] UMLS registration completed
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] Scaffold forked and tested
- [ ] Initial test PDF prepared
- [ ] Config file customized for Mexican settings

### Success Criteria for Day 1
- [ ] Scaffold runs with sample PDF
- [ ] Mexican PHI patterns detected
- [ ] Basic translation working
- [ ] Output PDF generated

## Conclusion

**We are READY to begin implementation!** 

The planning phase is complete, resources are identified, and we have a clear path forward. The MedsafeMT scaffold eliminates most infrastructure work, letting us focus on the Mexican medical layer.

**Next Action**: Register for UMLS account and start coding tomorrow.
