## Executive Summary

Enfermera Elena is a GPU-accelerated medical record translation system designed to bridge the language gap in healthcare by providing accurate, context-aware translation of Mexican Spanish medical documents to English. The system is optimized for Mexican healthcare terminology, IMSS/ISSSTE documentation formats, and serves US healthcare providers treating Mexican patients.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Mexican Patient Population**: 37% of US Spanish speakers are Mexican origin, requiring specific terminology
2. **Translation Errors**: Generic tools don't understand IMSS terminology or Mexican pharmaceutical names
3. **Time Delays**: Manual translation of Mexican medical records creates care bottlenecks
4. **Compliance Issues**: Existing tools don't meet HIPAA requirements
5. **Mexican Medical System**: Unique terminology from IMSS, ISSSTE, and Seguro Popular unfamiliar to US providers

### Impact
- Delayed diagnoses and treatment
- Increased medical errors
- Higher healthcare costs
- Patient safety risks
- Legal liability exposure

## Product Vision

### Mission
Eliminate language barriers in healthcare by providing instant, accurate, and compliant Mexican Spanish-to-English medical record translation tailored for Mexican healthcare documentation.

### Vision
Become the gold standard for medical translation, enabling seamless care for Spanish-speaking patients worldwide.

### Core Values
- **Accuracy Above All**: Never compromise on clinical accuracy
